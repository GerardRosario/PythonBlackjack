# Blackjack Game

> This game was made with Python and Tkinter.

- The game is fairly simple. It starts with three cards and four bottom buttons.
- The player can see both his/her hand and the dealers hand. 
- He/She can then choose to draw a card by clicking the player button.
- The player shall endeavor to get a number close to 21, by adding the numerical value of the cards 2-10.
  - The Jack, Queen, and King all add a value of 10.
  - The ace can add a value of 1 or 11, depending on the hodler's choice.

- If the player draws a numerical sum that is over the number 21, they will loose, and the dealer will win.
- If the player draws a hand with a sum less than 21 and are satisfied with said hand, they can then click the dealer button.
- Clicking the dealer button will make the dealer draw cards. The dealer will draw until it draws a sum that is higher than the player's and wins,
or the dealer draws a hand with a sum greater than 21, in which case, the dealer looses and the player wins.

The third button is a "New Game" button, which will reset the game, without having to redeploy the whole program.

The final button is a shuffle button, which just reorders the cards in the deck.
